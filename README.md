## 5 Obtaining the source

The source code can be obtained from GitHub.([Here](https://github.com/XiaoJi-Game/China-Set-Aircraft))

1.Download source code.

2.Change a few files, or change nothing.

3.Use GoRender.GoRender produces dimetric-projection sprites for games such as Transport Tycoon / OpenTTD from voxel objects in the MagicaVoxel file format.

4.Running pybuild.bat (NML Py-Patcher).it can read references from pnml files to patch together and use custom variable definitions for reference in the code.
The rest will just be written directly to the nml file to be compiled.

5.Now you get a grf files.Finishing now!
